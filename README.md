#jrpg-example
Just a project where I'm refactoring code from an old JRPG project, which had an ATB system combined with a timed hits mechanic. 
After I refactor some of the code, I will make the project look prettier. But I'll worry about that later, potentially in a different repo.
But for this repo, CUBE will fight CUBE.

TO-DO:
- Update README.md when there's more here.
